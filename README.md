# RGL (Riley's OpenGL abstraction Layer)
Simple OpenGL version abstraction layer based on [RLGL](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/rlgl.h). 

Allows you to use Modern OpenGL using the simple pipeline format.

Allows you to switch between Modern OpenGL and Legacy OpenGL without changing the code.

# Documentation 
For documentation read the `RGL.h` file and check out the example in `./example`

Most OpenGL legacy documentation and examples should also apply to RGLx
